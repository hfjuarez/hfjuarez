As a Full-Stack Developer, I've been working on the analysis and design, development, and maintenance of websites, servers, and mobile applications for several local and international clients.

I work with Node and Vue, I worked with React, Ruby on Rails, Java, and always ready to learn new things!


## About my experience

Since I started, I have worked with agile methodologies, mainly SCRUM. My first job was at Cualit, a software factory, which allowed me to learn and work on different kinds of projects and areas. I learned from day one to deal with clients and I had weekly meetings with them.


Now, I work at The Sandbox, where I have learned to follow the best practices, write clean code and always keep performance in mind.
