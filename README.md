# About 
With a strong background as a Full-Stack Developer, I have developed solutions for various industries, including financial, healthcare, and real estate. 

My background lies in developing with NodeJS and Vue, and I've also gained proficiency in other popular frameworks like Ruby on Rails, React and React Native. 

As a result, I am ready to handle diverse project requirements and work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to achieve successful outcomes.

From the beginning of my career, I have worked with agile methodologies, particularly SCRUM. My experience started at Cualit, a software factory where I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects and areas, gaining invaluable knowledge in different technologies and tools. At Cualit, I quickly learned the importance of effective communication with clients, having regular weekly meetings with them to ensure we were achieving their expectations.

Currently, I am part of The Sandbox team, where I continue to follow industry best practices, with a strong focus on writing clean, efficient code that prioritizes performance. Through my time at The Sandbox, I have gained further experience in collaborating with cross-functional teams and adopting a growth mindset to improve my skills and knowledge.
