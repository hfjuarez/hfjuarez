With a strong background as a Full-Stack Developer, I have developed solutions for various industries, including financial, healthcare, and real estate. 

My expertise lies in utilizing NodeJS and Vue, and I have also gained proficiency in other popular frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, React, React Native and Java. 

As a result, I am ready to handle diverse project requirements and work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to achieve successful outcomes.


## About my experience

Since I started, I have worked with agile methodologies, mainly SCRUM. My first job was at Cualit, a software factory, which allowed me to learn and work on different kinds of projects and areas. I learned from day one to deal with clients and I had weekly meetings with them.


Now, I work at The Sandbox, where I have learned to follow the best practices, write clean code and always keep performance in mind.
