With a strong background as a Full-Stack Developer, I have developed solutions for various industries, including financial, healthcare, and real estate. 

My expertise lies in developing with NodeJS and Vue, and I have also gained proficiency in other popular frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, React, React Native and Java.

As a result, I am ready to handle diverse project requirements and work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to achieve successful outcomes.


## About my experience

From the beginning of my career, I have worked with agile methodologies, particularly SCRUM. My experience started at Cualit, a software factory where I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects and areas, gaining invaluable knowledge in different technologies and tools. At Cualit, I quickly learned the importance of effective communication with clients, having regular weekly meetings with them to ensure we were achieving their expectations.

Currently, I am part of The Sandbox team, where I continue to follow industry best practices, with a strong focus on writing clean, efficient code that prioritizes performance. Through my time at The Sandbox, I have gained further experience in collaborating with cross-functional teams and adopting a growth mindset to improve my skills and knowledge.
