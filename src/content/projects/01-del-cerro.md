## The old portfolio

The one you're looking at right now — or rather, the one before this one. Built as a clean, minimal site to ship fast and stop overthinking design.

## What it does

A single-page portfolio with a hero section, project cards, and contact links. Nothing revolutionary — the goal was to have something live while I worked on something better.

## Stack

Built with **Vue 3** and **TypeScript** on the frontend, **Node.js** for a small backend layer, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Deployed on Railway.

## What I'd do differently

Exactly this — replace it with a macOS desktop simulation.
