# Hernán Fabrica

I build frontend systems that scale—and I love solving the hard problems that come with it.

As a Frontend Engineer with 4+ years of experience, I specialize in turning complex business challenges into intuitive, high-performance user interfaces. My approach combines technical execution with product thinking and a deep understanding of user needs.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT

I see systems where others see features.

My strength is systemic thinking—I connect dots that aren't obviously related, anticipate edge cases before they become production bugs, and design solutions that work elegantly today and still scale in 6 months. I don't just ask "does it work?" but "will this architecture support 10x growth?"

This ability has been validated by colleagues, clients, and the products I've shipped—from a LAND Sale system generating $1.5M in revenue to a custom CRM managing 230+ clients.
